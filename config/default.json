      // Removing nodeIntegration breaks any plugin making use of native node bindings
      // (those crash when used in Web Workers within Electron). As a workaround, we
      // now use node's process.fork() to launch the worker as a node child process
      // instead, and write the worker in such a way that it can handle being run
      // in that manner in addition to the typical Web Worker path on the web.
      //
      // This can be swapped back for security if Electron fixes the crashing issue,
      // but code changes will still need to be made to those plugins as well.
